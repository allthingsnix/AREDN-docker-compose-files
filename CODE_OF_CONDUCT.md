## Categories of Conduct

## Overall Conduct

This section defines how each contributor/member should and should not act while participating in contributing to the allthingsnix organization. Everyone is required to adhere to not only this section, but also the following eight sections of this Code of Conduct. Most important in this section is that members respect their peers, regardless of race or gender, as learners. This is an organization in which individuals have different skillsets and different levels of mastery in those skills, and disrespecting or shunning a contributor/member for lack of knowledge violates this Code of Conduct. Viewing and using other people's work is a core part of learning and the development life-cycle, yet when used irresponsibly (such as directly copying another peer's work without their permission or without crediting them) such code will negatively impact learning success. Therefore, contributors/members of this organization should adhere to the allthingsnix's honor code for all submitted work.

- Acceptable Conduct (A):

  - Contributors/Members shall

    - Show respect for all peers as learners and team members
    - Allow peers to voice their opinions and questions
    - Read, understand, and adhere to all parts of this Code of Conduct

- Unacceptable Conduct (U):

  - Contributors/Members shall not

    - Disrespect peers because of their race or gender
    - Prevent peers from voicing their opinions and questions
    - Violate any part of this Code of Conduct
    - Directly copy another peer's work without crediting them
    - Inhibit or otherwise hinder the progress of any peer's work

### Deadlines

- Acceptable Conduct (A):

  - Members shall

    - Update Cards on the Project Board as needed
    - Create New Cards on the Project Board as needed

- Unacceptable Conduct (U):

  - Members shall not

    - Block others ability to complete Cards they are working on
    - Delete Cards without first speaking to all other members on the Project

### Communication

Since the nature of community driven development is typically online and remote, the following standards should be used.

- Acceptable Conduct (A):

  - Members shall

    - Conduct all communication to a respectful and concise manner
    - Provide all communications in writing via Email, Messenger, or any other digital format of choosing

## Team Work

Some of the organizations activities will require team collaboration. This section of the Code of Conduct will provide guidance on effective and inclusive team work.

### Participation

Every contributor/member needs to be actively and cooperatively involved with the organizations activities at hand. This will ensure the flow of questions, ideas, and thoughts in a respectful manner. Our environment at its root includes participation, candidness and insightful collaboration. Participating in team-based project discussion means engaging in conversation, not just answering questions. The goal here is to show up and truly be all there.

  - Members shall

    - Respond quickly to any messages to clarify confusing issues or assist other colleagues

    - Avoid contributing to discussions
    - Discriminate against team members based on race, class year, gender, or level of knowledge

### Decisions

The majority of individuals in a team should agree on a given decision before the project is implemented. It should be made with supporting evidence that shows that the decision is productive. When unsure about making a decision it is a good idea to defer to a technical leader. One should reach out to other teams whom the choice will influence. Teams will determine how long a decision will take to implement.

- Acceptable Conduct (A):

  - Members shall

    - Take into account everyone's input in the decision making process
    - Stay flexible and be willing to change if productive
    - Report errors or bugs to the appropriate team members

    - Defer to the technical leaders when unsure about tasks or implementation
    - Distribute tasks to all team members evenly
    - Make new decisions when a previous decision cannot be implemented
    - Use Github issue tracker when a choice is disputed and let team members share their opinion
    - Use efficient communication within and outside of teams

- Unacceptable Conduct (U):

  - Members shall not

    - Let an individual team member or a project manager make major decisions
    - Make decisions without finding evidence showing that it would likely be beneficial

    - Make decisions that would affect another team without first notifying them
    - Refuse to actively participate in group discussions to reach an optimal final decision

    - Interfere in matters or responsibilities that they were not designated to handle
    - Deploy any kind of decision that against codes of ethics

### Postmortems

Postmortems are great ways of looking at and analyzing the performance of the project after its launch. Through postmortems we can look at what was successful and what failed and needs improvement. These discussions also provide great insight in how to improve in future projects.

- Acceptable Conduct (A):

  - Members shall

    - Work as a team to create a postmortem plan to review and fix sections of the project
    - Develop different approaches to solve issues with the project
    - Provide constructive feedback and propose solutions for issues faced
    - Receive feedback and discuss how it could be used to improve future projects and assignments
    - Communicate and think practically/realistically on ways to improve the program based on efficiency and the skills
    - Account for situational factors that may come up with remote work when giving feedback and discussing solutions
    - Keep postmortems blameless to increase the accountability in a group and to prevent team members from being blamed
    - Respect that all decisions coming from the results of a postmortem should be arrived through a democratic process based on a majority support from group members

- Unacceptable Conduct (U):

  - Members shall not

    - nsult others while presenting criticism
    - Blame other members for any issues with the final product

    - Take all credit for all of the team members work that the individual did not do and blame others for everything wrong
    - Target a specific team member when discussing a postmortem or the remaining bugs in a laboratory or project assignment
    - Decide what to do after a postmortem that the majority of the project or laboratory group doesn't agree with
    - Claim that one subjective way of achieving a solution is the only correct way of working towards it

- Acceptable Conduct (A):

  - Members shall

    - Resolve conflicts before they become severe by engaging in respectful conversations
    - Communicate with project managers, if conflicts become severe between contributors/members, who will work to resolve any issues
    - Project managers may reassign different tasks to group members to solve a conflict
    - Be respectful and open-minded with everybody in the team when encountering a conflict
    - Report conflict involving violence to the allthingsnix owners
    - Be considerate and listen to everyone in the group carefully before determining a suitable solution for the issue
    - Politely disagree with other students ideas but not in a way that harms the group or individuals
